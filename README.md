Atmega 32 drivers (Version 1.5)
# Peripheral And Module Drivers For Atmega32

A repository for drivers built specifically for **Atmega32 AVR Micro-controller** with **layered Architecture** applied.  
This was developed during my time enrolled in Embedded Systems Track With IEEE Zagazig Branch.
This repository can be useful to anyone in the process of learning Embedded Systems, and working with AVR.

## List of Existing Drivers (most recent)
1. DIO peripheral (MCAL Layer)
2. LCD module (HAL Layer)
